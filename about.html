	<p>I am Tyler Thompson.
	<p>On the early morning of August 9, 2014, I was driving the wrong way on the 210 Westbound Freeway and was the cause of a head on collision with another vehicle driving in the correct direction. Justin Romo, the driver of the other vehicle, was killed and his passenger, Randi L., was critically injured. I was driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>
	<p>I am currently incarcerated and there is not a day that goes by where I do not wish I could go back and trade places with Justin to reunite him with his family and loved ones. There is not a day that goes by where I wish I could protect Randi from all the pain and suffering I have caused her. There is not a day that goes by where I do not feel remorseful for all the pain, sorrow, and grief I have caused the Romo and Lindberg family. There is not a day that goes by where I wish I could go back in time and make the correct choice.</p>
        <p>Throughout my incarceration journey, I have committed myself to becoming the person that Justin and Randi should have crossed paths with on August 9th, 2014. Education played a significant role in this development. I earned an Associate of Arts in Social and Behavioral Sciences, and a Bachelor of Arts in Intercultural Studies, and a Master of Arts in Organizational Leadership. Also, I have participated in many self-help groups which brought awareness to my past choices.
	<p>I know this remorse, grief, shame, and regret will remain with me for the rest of my life. I made a promise in honor of Justin Romo, Randi Lindberg, and their families to become the person that Justin and Randi deserve to have met; instead of that selfish, inconsiderate, and irresponsible person which formerly described me. Every day I work to make a positive connection and impact with the people I am blessed to encounter.</p>
        <p>That is why I created this website with the help of my loved ones. I pray that this message touches the Readerâ€™s heart. I pray it aids the Reader in thinking of the potential consequences of his/her choices and that he/she makes the correct choice. The choice that does not create any victims. We can help to lessen the negative impact by being aware of our choices.</p>
