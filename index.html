        <p>A young man lost his life and a young woman was critically injured. They were involved in a head on automobile collision. The cause of this tragedy was a 24-year-old man who was driving the wrong way on the freeway. He was driving under the influence of alcohol, which was a senseless, reckless, and negligent <strong>CHOICE!</strong></p>

	<p>Too many people are victimized because individuals are not aware of the potential magnitude and impact of every choice we make.</p>
	<br \>
	<p>The purpose of this website is to inform people of the power and remifications of their choices. Also to demonstrate how oneâ€™s choices not only effect themselves as well as everyone around and connected to them.</p>
